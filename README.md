# Energy-Efficient-WP-webshop-dev Overview

This project is divided into two main parts:

---

## Server Side ‚Äî WordPress Custom Webshop

- A fully custom WordPress theme called **Urban Shop** created from scratch.
- Products are managed as **Posts**, and the Shop, Cart, and Checkout are built using **Pages** and custom templates.
- Minimalistic, lightweight, and designed for energy-efficiency testing.
- Currently tested on the Urban Shop theme.
- The same setup will soon be adapted and extended to the official **WordPress 2025 theme** for broader testing and comparison.

---

## Client Side ‚Äî Selenium Automated Testing

- Selenium scripts automate full user flows on the webshop:
  - Browse all products
  - Randomly add products to the cart
  - View the cart
  - Checkout
  - Reset cart session
- Logs all actions into a CSV file for tracking user interactions and preparing for energy consumption analysis.
